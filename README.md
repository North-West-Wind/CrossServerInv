# Cross Server Inventory
Sync your inventory across servers. Idea from [InvSync](https://github.com/MrNavaStar/InvSync), but they still haven't updated to 1.20.1, so I decided to make my own.

## Configuration
Config file is located at `config/csi.json`:
```json
{
  "mysql_address": "",
  "mysql_port": 3306,
  "mysql_username": "",
  "mysql_password": "",
  "db_name": ""
}
```
